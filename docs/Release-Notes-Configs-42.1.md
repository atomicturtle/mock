## [Release Configs 42.1](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/mock/Release-Notes-Configs-42.1) - 2025-01-16


### Mock Core Configs changes

- Configuration files for Fedora 42 have been branched from Rawhide.  This has
  been done before the actual branching, to make the users' transition fluent
  before, during and after the branching event according to the [Fedora 42
  Schedule](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/f-42/f-42-all-tasks.html).
  See [PR#1529][].

[PR#1529]: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/pull/1529
